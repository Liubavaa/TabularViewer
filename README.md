# Data Viewer  

A lightweight standalone tool for viewing and summarizing data in multiple file formats, including `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.sas`, `.xpt`.  

## How to Run  

### Using Python  
If the standalone `.exe` doesn't work, you can run the project directly with Python:  
1. Install Python (version 3.7 or above).  
2. Install the required libraries with:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the application with:  
   ```bash  
   python viewer.py  
   ```  

4. (Optional) If application doesn't work because of `tkinter`:
   ```bash  
   brew install python-tk
   ```
